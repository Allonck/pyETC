Illustrative example
--------------------

To use pyETC in a project:

.. code:: python

   >>> import os
   >>> from pyETC.pyETC import etc
    
   >>> # load ETC with a config file and the COLIBRI caracteristics
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC=etc(configFile=os.getenv('pyETC_DIR')+'/pyETC/configFiles/example.hjson',
            name_telescope='COLIBRI')
    
   >>> # Execute 
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.sim()

It will display the following information in the terminal:

.. literalinclude:: ./files/results_summary_Ex_illus.txt


As well as a summary plot:

.. image:: ./plots/Illustrative_example.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center


Compute the SNR for a given magnitude and exposure time
-------------------------------------------------------

We keep using COLIBRI telescope and let's say we want to compute the SNR reached for
a magnitude of 18 (AB) in a single exposure of 20s in the *i* band.

.. code:: python

   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['etc_type'] = 'snr'
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['object_type'] = 'magnitude'
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['object_magnitude'] = 18
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['exptime'] = 20
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['filter_band'] = 'i'
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.sim()

It will also display information and plots but we do not show them here. 
If you just want the SNR, you can get it through:

.. code:: python

      >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['SNR']
      49.92


Compute the limiting magnitude for a given SNR and exposure time
-------------------------------------------------------

We keep using COLIBRI telescope and this time we want to compute the limiting magnitude in the J band for a SNR of 10 and a single exposure of 30s. We need to use the NIR channel, which is named CAGIRE in the hjson file.

.. code:: python

   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['etc_type'] = 'mag'
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['SNR'] = 10
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['exptime'] = 30
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['channel'] = 'CAGIRE'
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['filter_band'] = 'J'
   
   >>> COLIBRI_ETC.sim()

It will also display information and plots but we do not show them here. 
If you just want the magnitude, you can get it through:

.. code:: python

      >>> COLIBRI_ETC.information['mag']
      19.13

Add new Telescope
=================

The telescopes are stored in pyETC/telescope_database/ in a hjson format.   
An example is seen below: 

.. literalinclude:: ./files/default.hjson
