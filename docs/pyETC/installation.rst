Installation
============


#Stable release
#--------------


#To install pyETC, run this command in your terminal:

#.. code-block:: console

#    $ pip install pyETC

#This is the preferred method to install pyETC, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

#If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for pyETC can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/dcorre/pyETC

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/dcorre/pyETC/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


If you want a developper version, meaning that you can modify the script
and these changes are automatically taken into account without having 
to install ``pyETC`` after each change, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py develop


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/dcorre/pyETC
.. _tarball: https://github.com/dcorre/pyETC/tarball/master
