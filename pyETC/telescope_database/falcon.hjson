#-------- optical design ------------------------#
# Set up the optical element in the telescope and each intrument channel.
# Note that the keywords used for defining the instrument channels are free to chose. However they must be reused for the cameras properties below.
# 'telescope' contains all optical elements common for all channels
# For each type of element (i.e 'mirrors', 'lenses'...) must correspond  a folder in pyETC/transmissions/
# These folders contain files in which the transmission are given. For instance here we have one lense N-BaK4 and the file must be  pyETC/transmissions/lenses/N-BaK4.txt
# You can add your own files and folders. #Pendiente
