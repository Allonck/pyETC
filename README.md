Features
--------
* Exposure Time Calculator configurable for any telescope in the optical/NIR domain.
* Telescope configuration and response defined by transmission curve of each optical element (mirrors, lenses, coating, filters, dichroics) and camera quntum efficiency. Also possible to provide only a global transmission curve.
* Object can be a givn magnitude (AB or Vega), a file containing a spectrum or a light curve. Can also be a simulated GRB light curve through the connection with [pyGRBaglow](https://github.com/dcorre/pyGRBaglow).
* Output is provided through a python dictionary.
* Have a look to the notebook(s) to see how it works.
